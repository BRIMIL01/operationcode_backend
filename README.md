Operation Code allows veterans to find a mentor in the field of software development.  


- Once they have joined, users can select whether they are a mentor or a mentee.

- Mentees can request a mentoring session. Mentors respond to those requests and can create squads of their own. Squads are groups of the mentees and a mentor (or more than 1) with a common interest or goal.

Diagrams can be found at (doc/data_models):
...doc/data_models/request.png - Illustrates how a mentee user can request a mentoring session
...doc/data_models/squad.png - Illustrates the mentor/mentee relationship of a squad.

We use Apiary for our API documentation, API mocking server, etc.

Please ensure that any PRs that change the behavior of the API are updated in the documentation as well. The API blueprint file is at `apiary.apib`, and the documentation itself is at http://docs.operationcodeapi.apiary.io/.
